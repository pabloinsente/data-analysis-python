    "Data analysis is a endeavor with fuzzy boundaries. Some people constrain data analysis to exploratory data analysis and data visualization. Others include hypothesis testing and statistical inference. And some even incorporate machine learning techniques like dimensionality reduction and clustering. \n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"Procedures for analyzing data, techniques for interpreting the results of such procedures, ways of planning the gathering of data to make its analysis easier, more precise or more accurate, and all the machinery and results of (mathematical) statistics which apply to analyzing data.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I personally agree with Tukey. In my 10 years of experience analysis data, I have done such wide variety of things to obtain an answer to a question that I cannot constrain the data analysis process to a fixed subset of techniques. Because, in my view, the heart of data analysis is precisely that: **to utilize a plethora of computational, mathematical, and visualization techniques, to answer meaningful questions based on data**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data analysis is often associated with a subset of roles in the Data Science space: data visualization specialists, business analysts, quantitative analysts, and a few others. Yet, the true i that **there is no endeavor in Data Science that does not rely in data analysis to some extent**. Machine learning researchers, machine learning engineers, data architects, big data engineers, social science researchers, biological science researchers, and pretty much any professional working with data, will need to ingest, clean, transform, explore, visualize, and interrogate data at one point or another.\n",
    "\n",

From that perspective, it is fair to ask why to spend time learning Python for data analysis instead of R and SPSS. I have several answers for that coming from different angles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You probably need to learn more than one programming language as every language has their own strengths and weaknesses. Adding Python to your toolbox will just make you a better analysis. \n",
    "2. I hear you: \"There is just so much time in a day. I cannot learn them all!\". Let's say you have time for learning a single programming language. Why Python?: (1) It's free, (2) It's easy to learn and use, (3) It has a large and constantly growing ecosystem of libraries to accomplish any data analysis task you may face, (4) It's in high demand. \n",
