    "The traditional way to communicate with relational databases is with [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) or Structured Query Language. There are many versions of SQL around, but they are all pretty similar. The `pandas` library is roughly based on SQL, and it does contain many SQL-like functions to manipulate data. In my experience, relational databases and SQL are the standard tool to deal with enterprise-level data systems, and `pandas` (and R, SPSS, and others) is most commonly used in research contexts and to prototype enterprise-level solutions. \n",
