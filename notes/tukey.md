Exploratory data analysis is about appearance, not confirmation. 

Pictures should "force" their messages upon us

Pictures that emphasize what we already know are not very useful. Pictures that require extensive examination and explanation are not very useful. Pictures that "force" us to see what we didn't expect to see are very useful. 

Paradox: exploratory data analysis is considered a lesser source of knowledge as it cannot confirm what appears to be true. Confirmatory data analysis is considered a greater source although their assumptions are impossible to confirm anyways. Ultimately, non can be confirmed.
